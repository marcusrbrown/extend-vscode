# Introduction

![Status: Planned](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Planned-blue)

This implementation plan establishes a comprehensive testing suite that includes visual regression testing with Playwright, performance benchmarking, automated accessibility testing, integration testing against multiple VS Code versions, and quality gates with threshold enforcement. All components integrate seamlessly with the existing GitHub Actions workflow while supporting both template and library use cases.

- **REQ-004**: Support integration testing against multiple VS Code versions
- **REQ-005**: Implement bundle size monitoring with threshold enforcement
- **REQ-006**: Add dependency vulnerability scanning with automated reporting
- **REQ-007**: Enhance code coverage reporting with configurable thresholds
- **REQ-008**: Integrate all testing into existing GitHub Actions workflow
- **SEC-001**: Ensure test data and artifacts don't expose sensitive information
- **SEC-002**: Validate security scanning covers both direct and transitive dependencies
- **CON-001**: Maintain compatibility with existing Vitest testing infrastructure
- **CON-002**: Support both template and library use cases in test configurations
- **CON-003**: Keep test execution time reasonable for CI/CD pipeline efficiency
- **GUD-001**: Follow established testing patterns and directory structures
- **GUD-002**: Implement progressive test enhancement without breaking existing tests
- **PAT-001**: Use modular testing architecture for easy maintenance and extension

## 3. Alternatives

- **ALT-001**: Separate testing repository - Rejected to maintain cohesive development workflow
- **ALT-002**: Manual testing approach - Rejected due to time consumption and human error potential
- **ALT-003**: Limited testing scope - Rejected as comprehensive coverage provides better quality assurance
- **ALT-004**: Third-party testing service only - Rejected to maintain control and cost efficiency

## 4. Dependencies

- **DEP-001**: @playwright/test for visual regression and UI interaction testing
- **DEP-002**: @axe-core/playwright for automated accessibility testing
- **DEP-003**: @size-limit/preset-node and @size-limit/preset-web for bundle size monitoring
- **DEP-004**: snyk or audit tools for dependency vulnerability scanning
